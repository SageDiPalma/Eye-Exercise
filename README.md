# Eye-Exercise
In the Eyes exercise, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. This exercise enhances JavaScript and CSS capabilities as you programmatically style and animate the eyes. Using manipulate styles and the DOM programmatically, these skills will make web pages more interactive.
